This system manages more than 400,000 personal shipments each year. Easing this process with Agile-at-Scale methodologies and data analytics reduces technical debt, enhances productivity, and maintains critical records at optimal cost and efficiency.</p><p>The future of the battlefield will be in the digital domain. To combat these threats, we will make continued investments in tools that both abate and mitigate cyberattacks. We will continue to invest in cyber programs that protect our nation’s mission-critical digital assets.
