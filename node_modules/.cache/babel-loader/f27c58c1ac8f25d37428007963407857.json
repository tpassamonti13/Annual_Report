analysts, and professionals are critical to our ongoing growth and success. Their talents enable our customer operations and enterprise modernization goals.</p><p>In FY22, enterprise expertise remained vital to business growth, including several awards, such as CACI’s prime position on the six-year multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2021/CACI-Awarded-Prime-Position-on-Technical-Services-Support-Contract-by-U.S.-Deputy-Chief-of-Naval-Operations/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Navy’s Technical Support Services (TSS) contract</a>, supporting manpower, personnel, training, and equipment (MPT&E), with a ceiling value of $575 million. Under the contract, CACI will continue to provide enterprise expertise to ensure sailor readiness and implement a transformation of the Navy HR information system. CACI has supported MPT&E for more than 25 years and this award directly supports the Navy’s mission to attract, train, and retain highly qualified personnel.</p><p>In addition to new business, CACI’s ongoing contracts drove significant revenue. CACI’s All Spark program continues to successfully expand, delivering more than $80.6 million in revenue to CACI. All Spark provides multisourcing service integration (MSI) for its Intelligence Community (IC) customer to ensure successful integration and operations of communications IT service providers. CACI helps our customer migrate to a managed service model, which ultimately improves the operations of the IC information technology enterprise (IC ITE). The customer has often referred to this as the “most important contract in the COMM portfolio.”</p><p>CACI also continues to provide end-user support solutions to our customers, including the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), and Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CTJF-HOA) to deliver enhanced IT and communications support. <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2019/CACI-Awarded-645-Million-GSA-Task-Order-to-Support-US-European-and-Africa-Commands/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This award was secured by CACI in FY20</a>, but expanded significantly in FY22, driving more than $126.5 million in revenue. CACI delivers each customer under the program hardware, software, and network IT and communications support services for continued maintenance of C4 systems. </p></div></Col><Col lg={6}><img src={enterpriseExpertiseImage} alt=\"Enterprise Expertise\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></Col></Row>;\n\n\tconst missionExpertiseContent = <Row><Col lg={6}><div className='columnTextInner'><p className='preHeader'>MISSION EXPERTISE</p><h4>Understanding Today’s Needs to Meet Tomorrow’s Demands</h4><p>CACI’s mission expertise continues to deliver the specialized talent, domain knowledge, and technical training that empowers our customers to meet their missions.</p><p>CACI is known for its strong partnerships with its customers, as is evident through its reception of <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2021/CACI-Wins-1.4-Billion-Task-Order-with-the-Defense-Threat-Reduction-Agency-to-Counter-and-Deter-Various-Threats/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Decisive Action task order</a>. The single-award task order, valued at $1.4 billion, can largely be credited to CACI’s intimate understanding of DTRA’s mission, spanning more than 14 years. The task order continues and expands CACI’s previous work with DTRA, providing the agency with a wide range of analytical expertise that enables mission solutions to counter and deter multi-faceted threats. CACI’s strong understanding of current threats supports DTRA to combat adversarial networks and threats.</p><p>Our technical and mission-critical expertise is well-recognized and well-received by our customers, such as the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2021/CACI-Wins-785-Million-Task-Order-with-U.S.-Army-Special-Operations-Command/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which awarded CACI with a five-year single-award task order worth up to $785 million</a>.
