Customer Enterprises</h3><p>At CACI, our expert software engineers, technologists, scientists, and professionals are vital to our continued growth and success, as their talent and functional knowledge are crucial to enabling customer operations and modernizing their enterprises. In FY21, our enterprise expertise was vital to expanding our business and several awards, such as CACI’s being awarded a prime position on a 10-year, multiple-award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a ceiling of $12.6 billion by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). As part of this award, CACI provides strategic, technical, and program management guidance and support for operations and modernization for DIA and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) infrastructure, systems, and applications. This enterprise work includes our specialized cybersecurity expertise, applications development and sustainment, and network services, among other elements. The award, largely new business, shows how CACI’s proven expertise and ability to recruit, train, and retain talent is helping modernize some of the most important elements of our customers’ enterprises.</p><p>CACI was also awarded a six-year, single award contract with a ceiling of $152 million with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide enterprise expertise to support the VA’s Financial Management Business Transformation Program (FMBT). As part of this contract, CACI software engineers use Agile methodologies and DevSecOps to help the VA convert its historical data onto its new integrated financial and acquisition management system — delivering the benefits of Agile at an enterprise scale with predictable, efficient, and transparent results.</p><p>The need for IT modernization and heightened global threats are both market drivers influencing CACI’s future investment. We believe the future of national security will be software based, and many of our customers have common underlying needs for new, flexible, efficient enterprise infrastructure. Expertise in Agile software development, flexible applications development, and a focus on open architectures all are key to future growth in this area.</p></div></Col><Col lg={6}><img src={enterpriseExpertiseImage} alt=\"Enterprise Expertise\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></Col></Row>;\n\n\tconst missionExpertiseContent = <Row><Col lg={6}><div className='columnTextInner'><h2>MISSION EXPERTISE</h2><h3>Meeting 21st Century Mission Demands</h3><p>CACI’s mission expertise continues to deliver specialized talent, technical expertise, and domain knowledge that help our customers execute their critical national security missions.</p><p>Our expertise in critical mission areas such as special operations and asymmetric threats is why we were awarded an eight-year $373 million contract from U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in FY21.
