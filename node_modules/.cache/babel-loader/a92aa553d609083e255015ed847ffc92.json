FY22, CACI continued to invest ahead of need and expand business in key expertise and technology areas such as <a href=\"https://www.caci.com/agile-solution-factory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

Continuing the success of our strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) program, we acquired four companies in FY22, including Bluestone Analytics, SA Photonics, and ID Technologies.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bluestone Analytics is a leader in dark web exploitation and analysis. Bluestone’s DarkBlue Intelligence Platform is an unclassified, secure, cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data and analytics tool that enables agencies to search and analyze critical data on the deep and dark web and select open-source intelligence (OSINT) platforms. Bluestone Analytics provides actionable intelligence for complex missions through automated data discovery and normalization, combined with powerful artificial intelligence (AI) to enable analysts to quickly identify and prioritize actionable threats and opportunities.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>SA Photonics is a leading provider of innovative multi-domain photonics technologies for FSO communications. CACI’s Optical and Photonics Solutions group already has decades of leadership and expertise in photonic design services, product development, and delivery of FSO communications and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensing solutions. The acquisition of SA Photonics enables CACI to offer advanced photonics engineering and manufacturing capabilities to the addressable market, spanning high-end manned flight programs to the valuable low-Earth orbit (LEO) market.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>ID Technologies is an innovator in enterprise IT, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and network modernization with Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) technology. The acquisition of ID Technologies expanded CACI’s secure network modernization capabilities with CSfC software, enabling government workers to operate virtually anywhere within essential systems that are vital to national security. ID Technologies also delivers product and engineering solutions capabilities to deliver cloud, network, and end-user services to customers.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>As is always the case, our success is because of our talented employees, our innovation, and our commitment to our customers, our company, and each other. We remain dedicated to providing the highest value expertise and technology our customers need to execute missions and modernize their enterprises.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Row><Col data-aos='fade-up' data-aos-duration='500' data-aos-delay='150' data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-offset=\"-5000\"><p className='preHeader'>ENTERPRISE EXPERTISE</p><h4>Modernization at Scale</h4><p>CACI’s expert engineers, scientists, analysts, and professionals are critical to our ongoing growth and success. Their talents enable our customer operations and enterprise modernization goals.</p><p>In FY22, enterprise expertise remained vital to business growth, including several awards, such as CACI’s prime position on the six-year multiple-award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2021/CACI-Awarded-Prime-Position-on-Technical-Services-Support-Contract-by-U.S.-Deputy-Chief-of-Naval-Operations/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Navy’s Technical Support Services (TSS) contract</a>, supporting manpower, personnel, training, and equipment (MPT&E), with a ceiling value of $575 million. Under the contract, CACI will continue to provide enterprise expertise to ensure sailor readiness and implement a transformation of the Navy HR information system. CACI has supported MPT&E for more than 25 years and this award directly supports the Navy’s mission to attract, train, and retain highly qualified personnel.</p><p>In addition to new business, CACI’s ongoing contracts drove significant revenue. CACI’s All Spark program continues to successfully expand, delivering more than $80.6 million in revenue to CACI. All Spark provides multisourcing service integration (MSI) for its Intelligence Community (IC) customer to ensure successful integration and operations of communications IT service providers. CACI helps our customer migrate to a managed service model, which ultimately improves the operations of the IC information technology enterprise (IC ITE). The customer has often referred to this as the “most important contract in the communications portfolio.”</p><p>CACI also continues to provide end-user support solutions to our customers, including the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), U.S. European Command (EUCOM), and Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CTJF-HOA) to deliver enhanced IT and communications support. <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2019/CACI-Awarded-645-Million-GSA-Task-Order-to-Support-US-European-and-Africa-Commands/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This award was secured by CACI in FY20</a>, but expanded significantly in FY22, driving more than $126.5 million in revenue. CACI delivers each customer under the program hardware, software, and network IT and communications support services for continued maintenance of C4 systems. </p></Col><Col data-aos='fade' data-aos-duration='500' data-aos-delay='150' data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-offset=\"-5000\" lg={6}><img src={enterpriseExpertiseImage} alt=\"Enterprise Expertise\" width=\"100%\" /></Col></Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Row><Col lg={{span: 6, order: 1}} xs={{order: 2}} sm={{order: 2}}><img src={missionExpertiseImage} alt=\"Mission Expertise\" width=\"100%\" /></Col><Col lg={{span: 6, order: 2}} xs={{order: 1}} sm={{order: 1}}><p className='preHeader'>MISSION EXPERTISE</p><h4>Understanding Today’s Needs to Meet Tomorrow’s Demands</h4><p>CACI’s mission expertise continues to deliver the specialized talent, domain knowledge, and technical training that empowers our customers to meet their missions.</p><p>CACI is known for its strong partnerships with its customers, as is evident through its reception of <a href=\"https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2021/CACI-Wins-1.4-Billion-Task-Order-with-the-Defense-Threat-Reduction-Agency-to-Counter-and-Deter-Various-Threats/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Decisive Action task order</a>. The single-award task order, valued at $1.4 billion, can largely be credited to CACI’s intimate understanding of DTRA’s mission, spanning more than 14 years.
