The award for Special Operations Forces Emerging Threats, Operations, and Planning Support (SOFETOPS), provides expertise in integrated information warfare (IW) and EW solutions, training, readiness, and modernization, to help USASOC adapt to both present and future threats.</p><p>CACI was named the prime contract awardee on all 10 pools on the General Services Administration (GSA) ASTRO IDIQ contract. This award provides mission-specific data operations, artificial intelligence, and life cycle support expertise, including sustainment and modernization and ISR. The GSA contract is an easy-to-use acquisition vehicle, through which CACI’s renowned talent will support the government to quickly address mission needs across all domains.</p><p>CACI is known for its strong partnerships with its customers, as is evident through its reception of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Decisive Action task order. The single-award task order, valued at $1.4 billion, can largely be credited to CACI’s intimate understanding of DTRA’s mission, spanning more than 14 years. The task order continues and expands CACI’s previous work with DTRA, providing the agency with a wide range of analytical expertise that enables mission solutions to counter and deter multi-faceted threats. CACI’s strong understanding of current threats supports DTRA to combat adversarial networks and threats.</p><p>CACI’s mission experts also support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the department’s Tactical Communications task order. The TACCOM II program expands the scope and size of the company’s support to ICE, specifically providing development and maintenance activities for ICE’s critical voice communications capabilities.</p><p>By understanding the latest technological advances and possessing an equal intimacy with our customer’s mission needs, CACI knows how to best serve our customers and defend national security.</p></div></Col><Col lg={6}><img src={missionExpertiseImage} alt=\"Mission Expertise\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></Col></Row>;\n\n\tconst enterpriseTechnologyContent = <Row><Col lg={6}><div className='columnTextInner'><p className='preHeader'>ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY</p><h3>Leading Technologies to Modernize the Enterprise</h3><p>CACI knows the future is digital and believes in future-facing technology as an integral part of meeting our customers’ missions of tomorrow.</p><p>CACI’s IT modernization and digital transformation tools were crucial in our work for customers. CACI was awarded a task order valued at $258 million to expand the enterprise technology support to the Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI) program office’s financial management and end-to-end business processes. CACI’s at-scale technologies will support DAI’s process areas, including acquire to retire (A2R), cost accounting (CA), user management (UMX), budget formulation, procure to pay (P2P), and other financial processes. The latest technologies, software, and DevSecOps at-scale will advance DAI’s processes and procedures to meet their mission.</p><p>CACI also delivers enterprise technology to modernize U.S. Army networks under a new five-year (one-year base and four one-year options), single-award task order valued up to $514 million, to provide network modernization of outside plant (OSP) infrastructure and facilities. Our engineers, managers, and technicians will enhance capabilities and improve the capacity needed for an underground fiber optic cable infrastructure required to support robust, reliable, high-speed voice, video, and data networks for critical command and control systems. CACI will effectively deliver higher reliability and survivability to support all Army missions with virtually zero downtime.</p><p>CACI will also continue to provide enterprise technology support to the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) after winning a single-award task order valued at more than $36 million. This work, under the Defense Information System Agency’s Encore III contract, further expands our digital modernization solutions for air, land, and sea transportation for the Department of Defense (DOD). Our modern technology helps deliver efficiency and accuracy for the USTRANSCOM’s web-based personal property shipment management system. This system manages more than 400,000 personal shipments each year. Easing this process with Agile-at-Scale methodologies and data analytics reduces technical debt, enhances productivity, and maintains critical records at optimal cost and efficiency.</p><p>The future of the battlefield will be in the digital domain. To combat these threats, we will make continued investments in tools that both abate and eliminate cyberattacks. We will continue to invest in cyber programs that protect our nation’s mission-critical digital assets. And our CSfC program will enable the nation’s warfighters and government employees to access information, files, and data from any device, anywhere. CACI is dedicated to building long-term value for its customers through technology that protects our nation’s interests.</p></div></Col><Col lg={6}><img src={enterpriseTechnologyImage} alt=\"Enterprise Technology\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></Col></Row>;\n\treturn (\n\t\t<div className='contentArea'>\n\t\t\t<Container>\n\t\t\t\t<Row className='headerRow'>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col data-aos='fade-left' data-aos-duration='500'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1 className='fw-bold'>Expertise and Technology for Mission and Enterprise Customers</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Col>\n\t\t\t\t</Row>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<Row>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Col data-aos='fade-left' data-aos-duration='500' data-aos-delay='150'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In FY22, CACI continued to invest ahead of need and expand business in key expertise and technology areas such as Agile at scale software development, DevSecOps, Enterprise IT modernization, signals intelligence (SIGINT), counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS), photonics, and other areas to address our customers’ enterprise and mission challenges.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Following the success of our strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) program, we acquired two companies in FY22 – ID Technologies and SA Photonics.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>ID Technologies is an innovator in enterprise IT, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and network modernization with CSfC technology.
